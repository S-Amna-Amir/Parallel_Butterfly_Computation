## What the Code Does

- Loads a bipartite graph from a text file.
- Partitions the graph using **METIS** and distributes it across processes using **MPI**.
- Performs **butterfly counting** (subgraph patterns of 4 nodes) for:
  - Vertices
  - Edges
- Applies **peeling algorithms** to iteratively remove nodes or edges with the least butterfly count.
- Uses **OpenMP** to parallelize counting and peeling steps.
- Uses **MPI** to combine results across processes.

## How to Run

### 1. Compile
```bash
mpicxx -std=c++17 -fopenmp main.cpp graph.cpp -lmetis -o butterfly
```

### 2. Run
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
mpirun -np 2 ./butterfly input.txt 2
```

Replace `input.txt` with your bipartite graph file.

## Example Output
```text

total butterfly count: 1234
total edge peeling iterations: 27
total vertex peeling iterations: 31
total edges: 4567
|U| = 123
|V| = 321
```
